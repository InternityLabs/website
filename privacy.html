              </h2>
              <p>
                The Android app 'Win-X Launcher' does not collect any personal data.
                The only time we collect data is if the app encounters an exception (a crash or serious error), where
                we collect a limited crash report so we can diagnose and fix the problem.
              </p>

                Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at Internity Labs Inc., LLC.
                We are committed to protecting your personal information and your right to privacy by very simple
                approach: 'Not collecting it at all'.
                If you have any questions or concerns about our Android app, please contact us using above mentioned
                contact information.
                In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what limited crash
                information we collect if the app encounters an exception, how it is stored, and how it is used.
                If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please
                discontinue use of our App.

              <h5><b>Google user data</b></h5>
              <p>
                Currently, Win-X Launcher does not request access to any Google Account data and does not use Google
                Sign-In or any Google APIs that require accessing Google user data.
                We are in the process of adding optional Google Drive support, and it will follow the same pattern as
                OneDrive and pCloud (OAuth 2.0 tokens stored only on your device, and no cloud file data sent to
                Internity Labs). See the "Cloud Connections" section below for details.
              </p>

              <hr class="my-4">
              <h2 class="section-heading mb-4 text-center">
                <span class="section-heading-upper d-block">Cloud Connections</span>
              </h2>

              <h5><b>Third-party cloud accounts (pCloud, OneDrive, Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Win-X Launcher optionally allows you to connect to your pCloud and/or Microsoft OneDrive accounts.
                Google Drive support is in progress and, when available, will be optional.
                These connections are used to show your cloud files and folders in the app UI as a file browser.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Accessed (pCloud / OneDrive / Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                If you choose to connect an account, the app accesses only the cloud file/folder listing information
                needed to display the file browser UI and to perform actions you explicitly request.
                The app does not send your cloud files, folder names, or file contents to Internity Labs servers.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Usage (pCloud / OneDrive / Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                We use OAuth 2.0 to obtain authorization to access your account. OAuth tokens and related authorization
                information are stored only on your device using the platform's secure storage. This information is
                used only to keep you signed in and to access your pCloud/OneDrive content within the app.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cloud file/folder information is used only to render the file browser UI. It is not persisted by the
                app once the file browser is closed.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Sharing (pCloud / OneDrive / Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                We do not share your pCloud/OneDrive data with third parties. When you connect these accounts, the app
                communicates directly with the relevant provider services (pCloud, Microsoft OneDrive, and Google Drive
                when supported) to authenticate and to retrieve the information needed for the file browser.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Storage &amp; Protection (pCloud / OneDrive / Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                OAuth tokens and related authorization data are stored only on your device in secure storage. Internity
                Labs does not receive or store your OAuth tokens.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Retention &amp; Deletion (pCloud / OneDrive / Google Drive - planned)</b></h5>
              <p>
                You can disconnect your pCloud/OneDrive account(s) within the app to remove the stored OAuth tokens
                from your device. You can also remove all locally stored app data by clearing the app's storage from
                Android settings or uninstalling the app.
              </p>

                <span class="section-heading-upper d-block">Crash Reports</span>
              </h2>

              <h5><b>Data Sharing (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash report emails may be delivered and stored by email service providers (for example, Gmail) solely
                for the purpose of delivering and storing the crash report message in our support inbox.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Storage &amp; Protection (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                We store crash report emails in our support mailbox and restrict access to authorized Internity Labs
                personnel. We use reasonable security measures to help protect this information from unauthorized
                access, disclosure, modification, or destruction.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Data Retention &amp; Deletion (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash reports may be retained only as long as needed to troubleshoot and fix the issue, and may be
                deleted afterward. You can request deletion of crash report data by emailing
                <a href="mailto:InternityLabs@outlook.com">InternityLabs@outlook.com</a>.
                If available, please include your app instance ID ("DeviceId") and the approximate date/time of the
                crash report so we can locate and delete the relevant message(s).
              </p>

              <h5><b>Types of data collected (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>In case of an exception during the operation of the app, the following limited crash report data may be
                collected and sent to Internity Labs.</p>
              <p>
                • Code stack trace (exception stack trace) and related error details<br>
                • Version of Android on your device<br>
                • Device language<br>
                • Version of the Win-X Launcher app on your device<br>
                • App instance ID ("DeviceId") — a randomly generated identifier associated with this app installation
              </p>

              <h5><b>Example crash report (redacted) (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                The following is an illustrative example of what a crash report may look like. Identifiers and
                sensitive details (such as account identifiers, advertising IDs, file names, or full paths) are not
                included. The "DeviceId" shown below is a randomly generated app instance ID.
              </p>
              <div class="border rounded p-1 my-1 bg-light text-dark" style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
                <pre class="small m-0">AndroidVersion: 22
DeviceLanguage: en-PH
AppVersion: 30.3
DeviceId: 12345678  (randomly generated app instance ID)

  at &lt;YourAppNamespace&gt;.&lt;AnotherMethod&gt;(...)
</pre>
              </div>

              <h5><b>Method of data collection (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>The app programmatically sends the crash report via email to an account associated with Internity Labs.
              </p>

              <h5><b>How we use the data (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash reports are used only to identify, troubleshoot, and fix app issues. We do not sell crash report
                data and we do not use it for advertising, analytics, profiling, or marketing.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Where the data is stored (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash reports are stored in our support mailbox. We do not maintain a separate database of user data.
              </p>

              <h5><b>How long we keep the data (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash reports may be retained only as long as needed to troubleshoot and fix the issue, and may be
                deleted afterward.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Who can access the data (Crash report)</b></h5>
              <p>
                Crash reports may be reviewed by Internity Labs personnel as needed to diagnose and resolve the problem.
                We take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or
                unauthorized destruction of the crash report data.
              </p>

              <h5><b>App permissions granted to it by the user</b></h5>
              <p>
                App requests permission to certain features from your mobile device, including your mobile device's
                bluetooth, microphone, storage, notifications, location, and other features,
                but we do not collect or receive this information. It is only used by the app on your device, and it
                does not leave your device unless a crash report is sent during an exception as described above.
              </p>

              <h5><b>Changes to this privacy policy</b></h5>
              <p>
                The Owner reserves the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. It is strongly
                recommended to check this page often,
                referring to the date of the last modification listed at the bottom. We have no direct means to inform
                the users about the privacy policy updates.
